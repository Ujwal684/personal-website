<font color="white"><h2><p><i><font color="black"> A Friend is someone who support you,sympathizes with you,or patronizes a group.An eaily definition of that would be a person you know,like and trust.In these tough times we count on friend to help us get through. I like to think of friendship as everlasting,but is friendship truely forever? Can milesdrive you made after graduting from place like high school or collage? 
just imagine walking across the stage and never seeing the people you graduated with.well for those instances you can always join networking place like facebook.Facebook helps you connect with the people in your life. In those ways you would never be withouts your friends.
A friendship can be everlasting depending on the personalities in that relationship.Sometimes personalities can change for the good the bad in many friendships.You can never change a person through a friendship.Differences can set you apart. The defintion of a friend can changed over the years therefore that could be a contributing factor to wht we can count our friend on one hand.Think about it! when separting from friends for a while physically values and beliefs star to change.
Many may argue that is not true,but I will say I have lost many friends due to personality channge and belief some reasons may be because everyone in collage likes to smoke and drinks.I am not a fan of either which i believes is gross so i drop many friends due to the way they act toward me or others when differnt people are around.In the urbanworld we call that being "fake" fake is another way of saying you aren't what you claim to be. you don't stay true to yourself and totally honest.
On the other side people can change for the good to help each other in a friendship.Frienships can gain trust through one another in due to the people you are around.In a relationship trust is being able tell a secret under confidence to another people hoping they wont tell.
  So, friend is need is a friend indeed.</font></h2></p><i/></font>
