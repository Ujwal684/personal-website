<center><H2>MISS SEE FINALE</H2></center>
<p><i><h3> <br> Those days, I remember, I was invited by one of my friends, the contender of Miss SEE, Nikita lama, it was a glamorous day with three of my friends <b> Samita,  Shristi, Krishal.</b><br>
<br>We went on to support our friend to crown the Miss SEE title in Rastriya Naach Ghar, Jamal.We met the other friends from our neighbour school, Minvera English School. Six hours,from 2 pm to 8 pm, we starved due to our hunger, almost plunged on the floor. we lacked the money for our food. However, the finale went as expected after our friend won the title for singing talent. We were cheerful as it was almost 9 pm, we all four friend were supposed to be at home as early as possible. And, it happened, we reached our home in almost 9 mins duration.</br>
<br>The best experience I had with my friends.</br>
<br> Shristi, remember you laughed at us (Me and Krishal), when we were just as stupid.</br>
<br> Samita,remember you almost were unconscious after your appetite consumed you.</br>
<br> Krishal,remember we disturbed the whole hall just screaming and laughing at others' faults.</br>  </i></h3></p></h3>
