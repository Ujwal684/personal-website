<h1><center>Last Day Of School</center></h1>
<br><h2><p><i><font color="blue"> Last Day Of School</font>Saturday, the 20th Feb, 1977 was my last day at School. The students of class IX arranged a dressing program in honor of the outgoing students of class X.
	
<br>The school compound was covered with a beautiful glamour with the children sproughting with the beams of smiles on their faces. It was tastefully decorated with buntings and balloons. A stage was set up for speeches and cultural programmed. Under the shamiana, tables and seats were arranged for the students and teachers. The school loudspeaker was filling the atmosphere with the tunes of moving, patriotic film songs.</br>

<br>Students of class X, who were dressed in their best, assembled first of all, in the school garden. ‘There we had a group photographs of small groups of 8 to 10 students .  our Principal who always treated us like his own children and the teachers who spared no pains in preparing us for the final examination We took our exam all over good.
First of all, the representative of class IX read out the farewell address. I replied to this address on behalf of the students of class X. I thanked the students of class IX for arranging a party. I advised them to try to keep the good traditions of the school in the fields of games, cultural activities and studies. I then, expressed my sense of gratitude to our Principal and teachers who were always kind and nice to us.</br>

<br>After the speeches were over, we were served with hot tea, suppers, lunches and varying foods. Teachers went round to supervise the arrangement and service done by the student so class IX. This brought the function to an end. I bade farewell to my school and went home.  I shall always remember my last day at school.</br>
