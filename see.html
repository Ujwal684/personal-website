<p>Hey! It's me. I wonder if you guys are appealed towards my web page. I am obsessed that i am not able to use the css nor java script. But, its my effort from HTML.
  It's a glamour to represent myself through the website. Last but not least, I would like to thank <I>Krishal</I> and <I>Joon</I> who helped me out during this entire project.</p>
